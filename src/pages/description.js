    'Meet Moby, a two-year-old French Bulldog who embodies the qualities of quietness, shyness, and agreeableness. As an introvert, he tends to keep to himself but harbors a deep curiosity about the world around him. Moby finds boys on skateboards particularly intriguing and views them as fair game for exploration. However, his energy is limited, and he tends to grow tired quickly after running around. The hot and humid weather of Hong Kong poses a challenge for Moby, as it drains his energy and makes him uncomfortable. To combat this, he seeks solace in the comfort of air-conditioned spaces, finding respite and rejuvenation in cooler environments. Moby %quots s favorite spot to take a break and recharge is the local 7/11 convenience store, where he can enjoy a brief pause from the heat and replenish his energy.',
